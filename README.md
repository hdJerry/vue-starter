## 🚀 Quick Start (via NPX)

You can create a new project instantly using **npx** — no need to clone manually:

```bash

cd my-app
yarn dev
```

### ✅ Why this version works

- Your original style and sections remain intact.
- The `npx` option appears _first_, so new users see the fastest route.
- It reads smoothly and looks professional.

Would you like me to help you add **badges** at the top (npm version, license, build status, etc.)?
They make your README pop — especially once it’s public on GitHub and npm.
